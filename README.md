# Catchphrase Game

> This is a personal project! 

<p>
The objective is to create a <strong>"Catchphrase Game"</strong>, in which the player is given a random expression on the screen and then provides hints for their partner to guess the expression, before time's out.

#### Application Demo:

The inspiration comes from the game played on "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon".
